A Multiline Answer Test
M
C is _____.
N
null
2
A general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, it provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems.
A general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled code can run on all platforms that support it without the need for recompilation. Applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any of it's virtual machines regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
An interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, it's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
